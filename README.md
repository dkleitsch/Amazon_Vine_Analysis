# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview
Using AWS, PostgreSQL, Pandas, and PySpark an analysis of video game reviews from Amazon was conducted.  The analysis was completed to determine if a possitivity bias exists within the Amazon Vine review program, where reviewers are paid for their reviews.
## Results
- **Total Number of Reviews per Category**
-   Vine: 94
-   Non-Vine: 40471

- **Number of Five-Star Reviews per Category**
-   Vine: 48
-   Non-Vine: 15663

- **Percentage of Five-Star Reviews per Category**
-   Vine: 51.06%
-   Non-Vine: 38.70%

## Summary
There does appear to be some positivity bias within the Vine program.  Over half of the Vine reviews were positive (51.06%) compared to 38.70% of positive non-vine reviews.  Another analysis that could be performed to help support this conclusion would be to find the percentage of one-star reviews for each category.  This would help us see if the Vine reviews were also less negative than the non-vine reviews.
